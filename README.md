## Overview

This project's primary objective is to showcase advanced financial analysis and data management using Python. It provides practical examples for calculating complex financial metrics, managing financial data with Pandas, and reinforcing Python programming skills. The aim is to take your financial analysis capabilities to the next level.

## Project Description

### Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Calculation of Financial Metrics**: Demonstrating advanced financial metric calculations, such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
2. **Interest Calculations**: Illustrating the intricate details of simple and compound interest calculations, which are fundamental to financial analysis.
3. **Moving Averages**: In-depth exploration of moving averages, an invaluable tool for financial data analysis and trend identification.
4. **Portfolio Variance**: Comprehensive coverage of portfolio variance calculations, essential for risk assessment in financial investments.
5. **Financial Data Management**: Utilizing Pandas, a robust Python library, for efficient financial data management and analysis.
6. **Advanced Python Exercises**: Providing exercises that bridge advanced Python concepts like data types and loops with real-world financial applications.

By delving into these aspects, you'll gain an enhanced understanding of financial analysis, risk assessment, and data management within the domain of finance, all using Python.

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculating NPV and IRR

```python
import numpy_financial as npf
import numpy as np

cash_flows = np.array([-100000, 20000, 25000, 30000, 35000, 40000])
discount_rate = 0.1

npv = npf.npv(discount_rate, cash_flows)
irr = npf.irr(cash_flows)

print("Net Present Value:", npv)
print("Internal Rate of Return:", irr)



### Example 2: Simple and Compound Interest Calculation

principal = 10000
rate = 0.05
time = 5

simple_interest = principal * rate * time
compound_interest = principal * ((1 + rate) ** time - 1)

print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)
print "Compound Interest:", compound_interest)



### Example 3: Moving Averages

import pandas as pd

# Sample financial data in a DataFrame
data = {'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03', '2023-01-04', '2023-01-05'],
        'Price': [100, 102, 98, 105, 110]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate a simple moving average over a 3-day window
df['SMA_3'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=3).mean()

print(df)



### Example 4: Portfolio Variance Calculation

import numpy as np

# Sample portfolio with returns
portfolio_returns = [0.08, 0.12, 0.15, 0.1, 0.09]
weights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1, 0.15]

# Calculate portfolio variance
portfolio_variance = np.dot(weights, np.dot(np.cov(portfolio_returns), weights))
print("Portfolio Variance:", portfolio_variance)



### Example 5: Financial Data Management with Pandas

import pandas as pd

# Read financial data from a CSV file
financial_data = pd.read_csv('financial_data.csv')

# Explore the data, filter, and perform basic data manipulations
print("Data Head:")
print(financial_data.head())

# Calculate basic statistics
mean_price = financial_data['Price'].mean()
std_dev_price = financial_data['Price'].std()
print("Mean Price:", mean_price)
print("Standard Deviation of Price:", std_dev_price)



### Example 6: Basic Data Types and Looping Exercises
# Example: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10
sum_of_numbers = sum(range(1, 11))
print("Sum of Numbers:", sum_of_numbers)

# Example: For loop to calculate the factorial of a number
num = 5
factorial = 1
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial *= i
print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial)
